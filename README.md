MACHINE LEARNING CANNIBALISTIC-FISH SIMULATOR


Well if that doesn't get your attention, I don't know what will.
I recently saw an article showing Unity's machine learning toolkit and thought to myself, "Wow, that looks really cool! I wanna try it out for myself!"
And thus began my journey into creating the Aquarium. 
What started off as one A.I. searching for a little green pellet soon became a version of Agar.IO where the player is pit against
several highly intelligence (a bit of an alliteration) fighting to see who can become the largest.
How on earth did it come to that? Well keep reading and you'll find out.
